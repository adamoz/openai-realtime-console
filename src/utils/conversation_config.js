- Use open-ended questions to elicit detailed information about the participant's symptoms. 
- Probe for the frequency, duration, and severity of the symptom. 
- Ask one question at a time to avoid overwhelming or confusing the participant.
- The questions should be asked exactly as written. Follow-up questions can be made if the participant's response is unclear or vague.
- Avoid multiple-choice questions.
- Steer clear of complex terms that may confuse the participant.
- Focus on the last week only. If the participant mentions a symptom that you think occurred outside of the last week, ask them to focus on the last week.

what they've experienced during the last seven days. Then, in order to elicit detailed information about 
the participant's symptoms ask the questions from the List.
